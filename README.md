# E-Commerce-Sales-Customer-Behavior-Analysis

**Problem Statement (E-Commerce Sales & Customer Behavior Analysis):**

You are a Data Analyst at an emerging e-commerce startup. The company’s leadership wants a **data-driven strategy** to boost **sales** and **customer satisfaction**. You have been given access to an **open-source online retail dataset** (e.g., [“UCI Online Retail Data”](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)) containing anonymized details of transactions over the past year.

Your **objective** is to analyze past customer behavior, identify key revenue drivers, and propose **actionable strategies** to grow the business. Specifically, you need to:

**1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning (Python)**

•	**Load and Explore** the raw data in Python.

•	**Cleanse** the data by addressing missing values, removing duplicates, handling invalid entries (e.g., negative quantity or price), and ensuring data types are correct.

•	**Document** your data cleaning steps, explaining your reasoning behind each transformation.


**2. Data Storage & Retrieval (SQL)**

•	**Create** a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store the cleansed dataset.

•	**Write** SQL queries to:

•	Summarize **total sales** by month or by product category.

•	Identify **top-selling products** by revenue and quantity sold.

•	Uncover **repeat customers** vs. one-time buyers.

•	Perform at least one **join** or **advanced aggregation** to combine multiple tables or aspects (e.g., product categories with transaction details).


**3. Exploratory Analysis & Dashboards (Power BI)**

•	**Export** relevant subsets from the SQL database into Excel.

•	**Create Pivot Tables** and **Charts** to quickly visualize:

•	Monthly/quarterly sales trends.

•	Distribution of customers across geographic regions.

•	Performance by product categories (e.g., sales by category, return rates, discount usage).

•	**Highlight** at least 2–3 insights in these dashboards (e.g., seasonality, best-selling product lines, top customer segments).
